Adds a context menu item to reorganize cards in Anki.

When you right-click on a deck, the item `Map card types to decks` is added.

Suppose you run this on deck `Kanji`. This will remap, for example, any cards in `Kanji` with note type `JP to CN` to `Kanji::JP to CN`, and so forth for every note type.

If that subdeck does not exist, it will create one.
